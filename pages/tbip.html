            <p>
                The Internet is Dying, and we can't do anything about it. 
                It just seems inevitable that with the rise of generative AI, the internet will become a dumpsite of AI slop.
                You can very easily distinguish what was generated with AI from what was human created, 
                but it has come to a point where human written text has become a rare find.
                
            </p>
            <p>The internet no longer holds any personality, it just is a bunch of bots talking to one other.
                You could argue saying "No I only use AI to refine my writing, 
                it is still me who writes and posts on the internet", but look at it like this, does what you write sound like <strong>YOU</strong>?
                Nicholas Carr in his Article <a href="https://www.roughtype.com/?p=9271" target="_blank">Large Language Manglers</a> 
                makes a really good point; 
                he writes - <em>"LLMs give us ventriloquism in reverse. The mechanical dummy speaks through your mouth."</em> <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                In the early days of AI (which I reckon we are still in, but I'm referring to the first year or so when the first 
                few renditions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith_Eating_Spaghetti_test" target="_blank">Will Smith Eating Spaghetti</a> 
                were amusing as hell and looked uncanny as hell) 
                AI was trained on human written content, therefore it sounded mostly human 
                (or maybe it just felt like that because we'd never seen AI generated text before) 
                BUT NOW, since most text on the internet is AI generated, the AI train and generate cycle is almost an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros_(disambiguation)" target="_blank">Ouroboros</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                In the age when teachers use generative AI to create teaching materials and questions, 
                and students use generative AI to answer them and study, I believe there are many people 
                out there who do not want to depend on AI generated slop.
                </p>
                <p>
                This led to the birth of <em>The Better Internet Project</em>, 
                a community driven centralised repository of trusted content that has been created by humans. 
                This project is still in the early stages, and I hope I will be able to complete it by the end of this year.
