                #0 Welcome to the blog
            </h1>
            <p >
                I write here about the impact of AI, and it may seem that a lot of the titles in this blog suggest that this blog is just about that, 
                but we have other stuff coming too, like project updates, 
                possibly a piece about something cool I found, we'll see when the time comes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, what made me want to create this blog? 
                I listen to a lot of video/audio essays and at the time this idea of a blog came into my head, 
                I had this realization that I also have a lot to express about my feelings about AI, the use of AI etc etc. 
                I remember not really using AI for a while (when it became the buzz), and then being peer pressured into using it "because everyone does it, why not?". 
                WHY NOT? Kinda snowballed into constant AI dependence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me quote the last line of a ChatGPT answer here when I was asking for it to recognize a song from 2007: 
                <blockquote> <em> "If you find one that seems close but still not exact, tell me one detail you remember about its 
                    opening line or fight between vocals and guitar intensity — even one word can crack this." </em></blockquote>
                I gave it the exact description of the song, including what device I'd heard the song on, the year, the first few words of the song, 
                the pace, the instruments, and It just DID. NOT. GET. IT. Even after an hour. 
                I was texting a friend at the same time and I just told them that the song was from 2007, on a Nokia, and the first three words were 
                "You and I", and they sent me a link to this song and said "Check if it's this?" AND HOLY COW IT WAS. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQIrvHUPRv8" target="_blank"> Here's the song</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you come to think of it, AI is built to make you depend on it. 
                It keeps asking if you want something else from it. At first it might seem like "Aww ChatGPT is just too kind", 
                but you look at the bigger picture and you just see a slot machine that keeps you coming back for more. 
            </p>
            <p>
                AI Companies WANT TO MAKE YOU DEPENDENT ON THEM. 
                Here is a personal anecdote, I was so busy with logistics and stuff for the TEDx Event that I made ChatGPT write all my emails and letters. 
                At the time it just seemed efficient and less stressful for me, but then I tried to write a letter on my own, and alas, I could not remember the structure of one. 
                This is me, a person people used to come to ask for advice on how to write letters or make me write letters for them, a person who EXCELLED at this stuff, 
                and my mind was completely 
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 150%; color: rgb(133, 0, 0);">B . L . A . N . K</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I did not run to ChatGPT to write the letter, I googled it and wrote it on my own. 
                It may seem like a silly complaint, BUT, it adds up. It adds up big time. 
                We need to realise that we are losing touch with what came so easily to us before, we need to recognize this flaw in our behaviour 
                and catch hold of our abilities before it is too late.
            </p>
            <p>
                I digress, but that is exactly what this blog is for me. I used to write a lot before, 
                and then I started outsourcing it to LLMs for a bit, and I am trying to take control of my ability to write.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could say the same for code, people often go to LLMs to generate code. 
                They think 'obviously it must write better code than me no?'. But you must remember, before AI could write code, 
                humans were 100% able to write code, hell, complex and awesome code, better than any LLM could. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Never doubt what a human can do, if he wills, he will do it better than AI.</strong>
