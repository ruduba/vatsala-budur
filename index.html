    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I am a Computer Science Engineering Student currently in my 8th Semester. 
        I am proficient in C++, with a good hold over Python and Java. 
        I have worked on projects in the fields of ML, Blockchain, Web Dev, and a little bit on Game Dev. 
        My focus right now is creating projects with C++, 
        and I'm still planning out what to build! You can check out my previous projects <a href="index.html#projects">here</a>.

    </p>
    <p>I am very interested in the study of the impact of Artificial Intelligence on academics and human cognition. 
        This website is a platform for me to express my thoughts and findings on the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why did I make this website so… um… look so outdated? 
        I have been on the internet since I was 3 (that's a really long time ago), 
        and the internet at that time had so much personality. 
        Every website you visited felt like visiting a completely new corner of the internet. 
        But now, every website is the same, the same old gradients, the same old overdone template, 
        very corporate, too professional for my taste. I didn’t want my website to look like that, I
         wanted to make something that reflected who I am and expressed my interests. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So behold, welcome to <em>my</em> website <strike>(I have not purchased a domain name yet, probably hosting this on github pages lol)</strike>. 
        This place is reminiscent of the old days, the simpler times. 
        To be honest, this feels like home. Go ahead, explore!

                <p>My main goal for the rest of 2026, is to create a better internet, more specifically, a human internet. 
        This will be through <em>The Better Internet Project.</em>
        I believe that if a human being did not care to take the time and effort to 
        create something by themselves, there is no use in consuming it, 
        be it written text, generated images, art, videos, or even code.
